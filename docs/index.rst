TidalUSDK documentation
=====================================

TidalUSDK aims to be a feature-complete .NET Core library for interacting with TIDAL.
Anything do-able in the official client should be achievable with this library - but bear in mind this is an unofficial project!

Using this library comes with a big gotcha: **You can not use this to enable piracy (including back-ups)**.
