# .NET Tidal Unofficial SDK
This library aims to enable developers to write applications (e.g. media clients) that interact with TIDAL, providing audio stream URIs, metadata, etc.

# A note on piracy
**You do not have my permission to use this library for piracy purposes, and use of the library requires licence agreement which explicitly forbids any attempt to infringe on intellectual property living on TIDAL's streaming platform.**

Not only is ignoring this unethical, but also makes it more likely that TIDAL will take steps to obfuscate their API (i.e. audio stream encryption) and make development work significantly more difficult.
